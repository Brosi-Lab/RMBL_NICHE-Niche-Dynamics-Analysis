# RMBL_NICHE-Niche-Dynamics-Analysis
A basic analysis of plant-pollinator interaction niche dynamics and bloom abundance using the RMBL QNEST data

The code name for files associated with this project is "RMBL_NICHE" -- all files that I generated as part of this project have that prefix for quick searching

Here's some basic information about the project

Data:
QNEST RMBL data from 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
- plant-pollinator interaction observations
- plant bloom counts (number of flowering units per species)

The data were collected at three sites:
1) Avery Picnic
2) Gothic Town
3) Virginia Basin
Between June and August of each year

The interaction data included in the analysis in this repository (as of 07-APR-2020) include very coarse pollinator type identifications. Once the pollinator identifications have been completed at a higher resolution, the .Rmd file in this repository can be used as an outline for another analysis with the new-and-improved interaction dataset! Who knows what you'll find!

The analysis has four main parts:
1) Organize and clean the data
2) Calculate species-level metrics for the plant species observed at each site and on each date
3) Calculate the bloom metrics for each plant species observed at each site and on each date
4) Examine the relationships between plant species' blooms and their interactions (i.e. plant species interaction
